Dear user, 

Please make sure to install and build the Boost library into your computer using the visual studio prompt and its
commands in order to be able to run the program without compile errors! 

The game runs through all five phases of the game and can update to all different steps. 

The implementation of the game was made in order to allow the user to enter commands onto the input line. For instance, after each phase, 
a window of command line appears and allow the user to choose between many command options such as: 

		"DONE",
		"CLEAR", 
		"SHOW AVAILABLE RESOURCES", 
		"HELP",
		"SHOW MAP",
		"SHOW HOUSE AVAILABILITY",
		"SHOW PLAYER INFO"

Be careful to type these commmands in CAPS in order to run its function. This tool was created to help and serve the players and for 
additional features. 

-> If you wish to exit this mode, you just have to type: DONE, and it will move to the next phase.  

Thank you for trying Power Grid Concordia 2016 game! It was very fun and instructive to learn about design patterns and the world of C++. 

Have a great summer! 

Sincerely, 

TEAM U - Comp345 - WINTER 2016
